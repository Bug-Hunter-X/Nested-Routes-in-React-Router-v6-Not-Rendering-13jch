# React Router v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem lies in how nested routes are defined and handled, leading to unexpected behavior where nested routes fail to render.

## Problem

The provided code uses `react-router-dom` v6.  Although the nested routes are properly defined, they do not render when navigating to them. The parent route renders without issue, but its child routes remain inaccessible.

## Solution

A common cause is incorrect route definition, missing `element` props, or a faulty component hierarchy.
The solution focuses on addressing these potential causes and ensuring correct route configuration.
